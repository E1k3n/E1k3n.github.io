# From zero to less of a noob

Hello and welcome to my first blog post. I recently finished my bachelor’s degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity and am somewhat unsure of where my path leads for the coming year or two. I have a few projects I’ve deemed interesting and want to work with, and for future reminiscing I will do my best at documenting the parts I find interesting on this site. This will include tags like vulnerability scanning, tooling, test-environments, development and more infosec related stuffs. 


- [ ] Goals with this blog? Purpose of writing blog?
- [ ] What have I previously done?
- [ ] Include how and why I started in cybersecurity
- [ ] What have I done?
- [ ] What am I currently doing?
- [ ] What will I be blogging about? 
	- [ ] Errors

**A Few Extra Tips:**

- **Choose a title:** A catchy title will draw readers in. Examples: "Cybersecurity Chronicles," "The Newbie Hacker's Guide," "From Classroom to Keyboard: My Infosec Journey"
- **Add a personal touch:** Share a brief story or anecdote about why you're passionate about cybersecurity.
- **Keep it concise:** The first post sets the tone, so get to the point and leave your audience wanting more.
