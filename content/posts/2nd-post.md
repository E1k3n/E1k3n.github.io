# Blogging my journey

Hello and welcome to my first blog post. I recently finished my bachelor’s degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity and am somewhat unsure of where my path leads for the coming year or two. I have a few projects I’ve deemed interesting and want to work with, and for future reminiscing I will do my best at documenting the parts I find interesting on this site. This will include tags like vulnerability scanning, tooling, test-environments, development and more infosec related stuffs.
