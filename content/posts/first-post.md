# From zero to less of a noob

Hello and welcome to my first blog post. I recently finished my bachelor’s degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity and am somewhat unsure of where my path leads for the coming year or two. I have a few projects I’ve deemed interesting and want to work with, and for future reminiscing I will do my best at documenting the parts I find interesting on this site. This will include tags like vulnerability scanning, tooling, test-environments, development and more infosec related stuffs. 


- [ ] Goals with this blog? Purpose of writing blog?
- [ ] What have I previously done?
- [ ] Include how and why I started in cybersecurity
- [ ] What have I done?
- [ ] What am I currently doing?
- [ ] What will I be blogging about? 
	- [ ] Errors
	- [ ] Projects, new and future
	- [ ] Interesting articles and knowledge regarding infosec
	- [ ] News? 
	- [ ] Tools
	- [ ] Some personal setup?
- [ ] How did I setup this? 


**A Few Extra Tips:**

- **Choose a title:** A catchy title will draw readers in. Examples: "Cybersecurity Chronicles," "The Newbie Hacker's Guide," "From Classroom to Keyboard: My Infosec Journey"
- **Add a personal touch:** Share a brief story or anecdote about why you're passionate about cybersecurity.
- **Keep it concise:** The first post sets the tone, so get to the point and leave your audience wanting more.


# A Cybersecurity Graduate’s Quest of Leveling Up 

## Introduction

Is this thing on? Hellooo, fellow cyberhumans! I’m here to spill the tea on my journey from cybersecurity newbie to hopefully-not-so-newbie. I’m fresh off university with a bachelor’s degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity, ready to dive headfirst into the world of digital mischief and mayhem, but on the right side of the law, of course!

## Why Cybersecurity?
One particular podcast sparked my interest in cybersecurity. Darknet Diares, which I’ve been a huge advocate for, was the podcast I was eagerly listening to while hammering metal in my old job in a tinsmithing company. I heard stories about skilled penetration testers, nation state hackers and felt like I unlocked a new universe of fascinating stories and people. I quit my job to get my grades up for university and six months later I applied for Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. I somehow got admittance at NTNU, where I got the first introduction to actual computer knowledge, which was beyond the shallow knowledge I already possessed via gaming and daily computer use.

## What I’ve Done So Far
Finished my bachelor’s degree with a strong curiosity for offensive security, which our bachelor’s thesis displays. I was elected leader of the student union Login half-way into the second semester of the first year and started working part-time as a security analyst at a SOC. Being active in the student union, working part-time and having a full-time study presented me with challenges I haven’t had to face before, but also gave me enormous amounts of positive experiences, knowledge and connections I wouldn’t want to be without. 
The past three years have been absolutely invaluable for both personal and professional development. I have challenged myself and found a balance which is more sustainable than I started out with during my first and second year. I started using Ubuntu as my main operating system towards the end of my first year and used it all of second year before testing out window tiling managers. Sway was the WM of choice, which absolutely served it’s purpose even on Ubuntu, but I made the mistake of stumbling onto the [unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) reddit. Following the graduation, I ended up installing Arch linux, using hyprland as my environment of choice. I am still in the process of customizing my environment to my liking and might share my config (dotfiles) at some point if it is of any interest. 

## What I’m Currently Up To
Currently I am considering if I should accept the offer for admittance to a master in information security at NTNU, take a couple of programming subjects or if I should take a year where I work on projects I’ve set aside during the course of my studies due to not having enough time. I have always been fairly set on the fact that I want to pursuit offensive security at some point in my infosec career. After I got the environment up and running, I got this blog up and running utilizing github pages and Hugo. I am currently starting my journey with “The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook” by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto, which is referred to as a great fundament for any web application hacker wanting to get started. 

## Why this blog now exists (besides my undying love for cybersecurity)
**Accountability:** Let’s be real, did it even happen if I don’t write it down?
**Digital Time Capsule:** 
**Sharing is (sometimes) caring:** If my ramblings about 
	- [ ] Holding myself accountable
- [ ] Future reminiscing
- [ ] Documenting my experiences and road
- [ ] Hopefully I can drop some interesting rabbit holes someone can get value from reading up on or look back on at a later point.


## What you can expect
- Technical tutorials and guides (vulnerability scanning, tooling, testing, etc.)
- Project updates (ongoing and future)
- Insights into articles and knowledge I come across
- Tool recommendations and reviews
- Personal setup and workflow tips

## Closing
Thank you for reading my first ever blog post. I’m excited for what’s to come in the future adventures.
