## Introduction

Is this thing on? _Taps mic_ Helloooo, fellow cyberhumans! 👋 Your friendly neighborhood cybersecurity newbie here, fresh out of university with a degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. I'm ditching the metal shears for Caido/Burp and ready to dive headfirst into the wild world of ethical hacking. Buckle up, this is my first blog post.

## Why Cybersecurity?
Blame it on the Darknet Diaries. 🎧 This podcast (which I highly recommend, by the way) opened my eyes to a whole new universe while I was busy hammering metal at my old job in a tinsmithing firm. Stories of elite hackers, shadowy figures, and digital espionage? I was hooked. I knew I had to trade in my yellow safety goggles for a pair of blue light glasses and make my mark in the cybersecurity world.

## What I’ve Done So Far
Fast forward a few years, and I'm officially a cybersecurity grad! 🎓 My thesis focused on the dark arts of offensive security (don't worry, the ethical kind). But it wasn't all smooth sailing. Between lectures, assignments, late-night CTFs, leading the [student IT union](https://login.no), and working as a SOC analyst, I've definitely earned my battle scars. But hey, who needs sleep when you have caffeine and a passion for never ending security?

Speaking of passion, I've also become a full-fledged Linux convert. I went from the default Ubuntu Gnome environment to Sway, and now I'm rocking Hyprland on Arch Linux. It's been a journey of customization and endless tinkering.

## What I’m Currently Up To
Right now, I'm at a crossroads. Do I pursue a master's in information security?  Dive into some programming courses? Or maybe dedicate a year to tackling all those side projects that got neglected during my studies? 🤔 One thing's for sure: my sights are set on a career in offensive security. In the meantime, I'm sharpening my skills with ‘[The Web Application Hacker's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/1118026470)’ and setting up this blog (powered by GitHub Pages and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), in case you're curious).

## Why this blog now exists (besides my undying love for cybersecurity)

- **Accountability:** If it's not documented, did it really happen?
- **XP Boost:** This blog is my personal scrap book for leveling up my cybersecurity ninja skills.
- **Digital Time Capsule:** Think of this as a virtual scrapbook for my future self to laugh (or cringe) at.
- **Sharing is Caring (Sometimes):** If my stumbles and triumphs can help another aspiring hacker avoid a few faceplants, then I've done my part.
- **Rabbit Hole Central:** Come explore the weird and wonderful world of cybersecurity with me. Who knows what we'll uncover?
- **Grammar police, don’t @ me:** I am also using this blog to finally master the difference between “its” and “it’s”. Wish me luck!


## What you’re in for
- Project Show-and-Tell: Front-row seat to my ongoing and future cybersecurity escapades. Expect triumps, flops and everything in between. 
- Hacking how-to’s: I’ll be spilling the beans on all the juicy cybersecurity secrets I uncover. 
- Knowledge bombs: I’m constantly diving down rabbit holes of cybersecurity knowledge, and I’ll be sharing the most interesting nuggets I find along the way. 
- Tool time: I will be sharing the coolest and most relevant gadgets I’m trying out with honest reviews and appliances. 
- Events: Attending events is a good way to network, gain knowledge and stay motivated in a field which can easily lead to burnout or impostor syndrome. Being social is vital for multiple reasons. 
- My digital crib: I might be sharing my personal setup and maybe even a few embarrassing desktop screenshots if you’re lucky.
