Taps mic Helloooo, fellow cyberhumans! üëã Your friendly neighborhood cybersecurity newbie here, fresh out of university with a degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity.

Why Cybersecurity? Blame it on the Darknet Diaries. üéß This podcast (which I highly recommend, by the way) opened my eyes to a whole new universe while I was busy hammering metal at my old job in a tinsmithing firm.</description>

<p>Is this thing on? <em>Taps mic</em> Helloooo, fellow cyberhumans! üëã Your friendly neighborhood cybersecurity newbie here, fresh out of university with a degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. I&rsquo;m ditching the metal shears for Caido/Burp and ready to dive headfirst into the wild world of ethical hacking. Buckle up, this is my first blog post.</p>
<h2 id="why-cybersecurity">Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
<p>Blame it on the Darknet Diaries. üéß This podcast (which I highly recommend, by the way) opened my eyes to a whole new universe while I was busy hammering metal at my old job in a tinsmithing firm. Stories of elite hackers, shadowy figures, and digital espionage? I was hooked. I knew I had to trade in my yellow safety goggles for a pair of blue light glasses and make my mark in the cybersecurity world.</p>
<h2 id="what-ive-done-so-far">What I‚Äôve Done So Far</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I&rsquo;m officially a cybersecurity grad! üéì My thesis focused on the dark arts of offensive security (don&rsquo;t worry, the ethical kind). But it wasn&rsquo;t all smooth sailing. Between lectures, assignments, late-night CTFs, leading the <a href="https://login.no">student IT union</a>, and working as a SOC analyst, I&rsquo;ve definitely earned my battle scars. But hey, who needs sleep when you have caffeine and a passion for never ending security?</p>
<p>Speaking of passion, I&rsquo;ve also become a full-fledged Linux convert. I went from the default Ubuntu Gnome environment to Sway, and now I&rsquo;m rocking Hyprland on Arch Linux. It&rsquo;s been a journey of customization and endless tinkering.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-currently-up-to">What I‚Äôm Currently Up To</h2>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m at a crossroads. Do I pursue a master&rsquo;s in information security?  Dive into some programming courses? Or maybe dedicate a year to tackling all those side projects that got neglected during my studies? ü§î One thing&rsquo;s for sure: my sights are set on a career in offensive security. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m sharpening my skills with ‚Äò<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/1118026470">The Web Application Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</a>‚Äô and setting up this blog (powered by GitHub Pages and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, in case you&rsquo;re curious).</p>
<h2 id="why-this-blog-now-exists-besides-my-undying-love-for-cybersecurity">Why this blog now exists (besides my undying love for cybersecurity)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> If it&rsquo;s not documented, did it really happen?</li>
<li><strong>XP Boost:</strong> This blog is my personal scrap book for leveling up my cybersecurity ninja skills.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Time Capsule:</strong> Think of this as a virtual scrapbook for my future self to laugh (or cringe) at.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing is Caring (Sometimes):</strong> If my stumbles and triumphs can help another aspiring hacker avoid a few faceplants, then I&rsquo;ve done my part.</li>
<li><strong>Rabbit Hole Central:</strong> Come explore the weird and wonderful world of cybersecurity with me. Who knows what we&rsquo;ll uncover?</li>
<li><strong>Grammar police, don‚Äôt @ me:</strong> I am also using this blog to finally master the difference between ‚Äúits‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Äù. Wish me luck!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-youre-in-for">What you‚Äôre in for</h2>
<p><strong>Project Show-and-Tell:</strong> Expect regular updates on my cybersecurity adventures, from exciting breakthroughs to epic fails.
<strong>Hacking How-Tos:</strong> I&rsquo;ll share the tricks and tools I gather along the way, so you hopefully can level up your game too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge bombs: I‚Äôm constantly diving down rabbit holes of cybersecurity knowledge, and I‚Äôll be sharing the most interesting news, articles and other resources I find along the way.</li>
<li>Shiny new toys: I will be sharing some of the recent tools I‚Äôve encountered, used and tested.</li>
<li>Events: Attending events is a good way to network, gain knowledge and stay motivated in a field which can easily lead to burnout or impostor syndrome. Being social is vital for multiple reasons.</li>
<li>My digital crib: I might be sharing my personal setup and maybe even a few embarrassing desktop screenshots if you‚Äôre lucky.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thats-all">That‚Äôs all</h2>
<p>Thank you for sticking around for my cybersecurity debut. If you survived this post without a headache, congratulations. You‚Äôve earned a cookie! üç™ I hope you‚Äôll find some useful info, some laughs and maybe even new appreciation for cybersecurity related content. Don‚Äôt be a stranger, I go by the absolute banger name of ApocalypticWasteman on discord if you want to chat.</p>
