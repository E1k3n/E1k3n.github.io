Taps mic Helloooo, fellow cyberhumans! üëã Your friendly neighborhood cybersecurity newbie here, fresh out of university with a degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. I&amp;rsquo;m ditching the metal shears for Caido/Burp and ready to dive headfirst into the wild world of ethical hacking. Buckle up, this is my first blog post.
Why Cybersecurity? Blame it on the Darknet Diaries. üéß This podcast (which I highly recommend, by the way) opened my eyes to a whole new universe while I was busy hammering metal at my old job in a tinsmithing firm.</description>

<p>Is this thing on? <em>Taps mic</em> Helloooo, fellow cyberhumans! üëã Your friendly neighborhood cybersecurity newbie here, fresh out of university with a degree in Digital Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. I&rsquo;m ditching the metal shears for Caido/Burp and ready to dive headfirst into the wild world of ethical hacking. Buckle up, this is my first blog post.</p>
<h2 id="why-cybersecurity">Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
<p>Blame it on the Darknet Diaries. üéß This podcast (which I highly recommend, by the way) opened my eyes to a whole new universe while I was busy hammering metal at my old job in a tinsmithing firm. Stories of elite hackers, shadowy figures, and digital espionage? I was hooked. I knew I had to trade in my yellow safety goggles for a pair of blue light glasses and make my mark in the cybersecurity world.</p>
<h2 id="what-ive-done-so-far">What I‚Äôve Done So Far</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and I&rsquo;m officially a cybersecurity grad! üéì My thesis focused on the dark arts of offensive security (don&rsquo;t worry, the ethical kind). But it wasn&rsquo;t all smooth sailing. Between lectures, assignments, late-night CTFs, leading the <a href="https://login.no">student IT union</a>, and working as a SOC analyst, I&rsquo;ve definitely earned my battle scars. But hey, who needs sleep when you have caffeine and a passion for never ending security?</p>
<p>Oh, and I should mention my love affair with Linux. I&rsquo;ve hopped from distro to distro, environment to environment throughout the degree, experimenting with tiling window managers and endlessly tweaking my setup. Currently, I&rsquo;m happily settled with Hyprland on Arch. Maybe one day I&rsquo;ll share my dotfiles with you ‚Äì but only if you promise not to judge my questionable color scheme. ü´£</p>
<h2 id="what-im-currently-up-to">What I‚Äôm Currently Up To</h2>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m at a crossroads. Do I pursue a master&rsquo;s in information security?  Dive into some programming courses? Or maybe dedicate a year to tackling all those side projects that got neglected during my studies? ü§î One thing&rsquo;s for sure: my sights are set on a career in offensive security. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m sharpening my skills with ‚Äò<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploiting/dp/1118026470">The Web Application Hacker&rsquo;s Handbook</a>‚Äô and trying my hand at this whole blogging thing (powered by GitHub Pages and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, in case you&rsquo;re curious).</p>
<h2 id="why-i-started-this-blog">Why i started this blog</h2>
<p>I started this blog for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> If it&rsquo;s not documented, did it really happen? Writing down my goals and progress helps me stay motivated and focused</li>
<li><strong>XP Boost:</strong> This blog is my personal scrap book for leveling up my cybersecurity ninja skills.</li>
<li><strong>Capturing my journey:</strong> Think of this as a digital diary for my future self to laugh (or cringe) at.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing is Caring (Sometimes):</strong> Hopefully, my experiences and insights can help other aspiring cybersecurity professionals on their own journeys and prevent a faceplant or two.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting with others:</strong> I‚Äôm excited to learn from and collaborate with other people who share my passion for security.</li>
<li><strong>To improve my writing:</strong> Because let‚Äôs be honest, my technical writing could use a bit of work</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-you-might-find-here">What you might find here</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A glimpse into my world:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be sharing my experiences as I navigate the cybersecurity landscape, from learning new skills to working on projects.</li>
<li><strong>Helpful resources:</strong> I&rsquo;ll pass along any interesting articles, tools, or tutorials that I come across.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Time (But Not Too Much):</strong> Occasionally, I&rsquo;ll review the tools and software I&rsquo;m using, but I promise not to bombard you with too many useless tools and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity in the Real World:</strong> If I attend any conferences or meetups, I&rsquo;ll share insights and takeaways.</li>
<li><strong>My digital crib:</strong> If you&rsquo;re curious about my workflow or the tools I use, I might share some glimpses into my personal setup. I have a personal road-map containing the projects I want to follow through with somewhere in the future.</li>
<li><strong>The occasional rant:</strong> Sometimes you just need to vent about that frustrating bug or problem you can‚Äôt figure out.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thanks-for-stopping-by">Thanks for stopping by!</h2>
<p>Thank you for sticking around for my cybersecurity debut. If you survived this post without a headache, congratulations. You‚Äôve earned a cookie! üç™ I hope you‚Äôll find some useful info, some laughs and maybe even new appreciation for cybersecurity related content. Don‚Äôt be a stranger, I go by the absolute banger name of ApocalypticWasteman on discord if you want to chat.</p>
